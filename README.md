# 🚀 Consumer Complaints Data Analyzer 📊 
This project analyzes consumer data to uncover insights and patterns using Python and data visualization libraries. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`Project_consumer.ipynb`) and is aimed at helping understand customer trends, preferences, and behavior.


🔧 What It Does:

This tool processes and analyzes a public dataset of consumer complaints to uncover valuable patterns and trends such as:

▪️ Most complained about products 📦

▪️ Complaint volume trends over time 📈 

▪️ Top states with the highest complaint counts 🗺️ 

▪️ Preferred complaint submission methods 📬 

▪️ Timely vs. delayed company responses ⏱️ 

▪️ Common sub-product specific issues 🧩 



📈 Visualizations Used:

▪️ Bar plots (log scale) for complaint volume

▪️ Line graphs for monthly trends

▪️ Horizontal bar charts for state rankings

▪️ Stacked bar charts for response timelines

▪️ Combo plots for sub-product issue pairs




🛠️ Tech Stack:

▪️ Python (Pandas, NumPy)

▪️ Seaborn & Matplotlib for plotting

▪️ Jupyter Notebook for development and insights

▪️ Real-world dataset (Consumer-complaints)


📌 Why This Matters: 


This project empowers organizations and policymakers to identify service gaps, improve consumer satisfaction, and allocate resources based on data-driven insights. It's a strong example of how EDA can provide clarity in complex datasets and enhance customer service strategies.
